# Hangman
In this project, I built an iOS application for the Hangman game. Users are able to:
- start a game,
- make guesses for a phrase,
- see their progress toward the phrase,
- see a list of previously guessed incorrect letters,
- see how many guesses they have left (indicated by a hangman image)
- be alerted of a win or loss, and start a new game afterwards.

## Takeaways
- Learned nuances of Model-View-Controller development
- Storyboarding: UI elements, Segues, Views
- Managing state (win, play, lose)
- Used plists to load data into appication

## How to play
Pull and build Hangman.xcodeproj
